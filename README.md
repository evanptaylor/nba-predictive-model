# nba-predictive-model

model.py is a predictive model for the outright winner of NBA games that uses machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of NBA games based on historical game data and upcoming Vegas odds. The model combines a Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost Classifier using a Voting Classifier to generate predictions. The predictions are loaded into an Excel file for readability. I also included certified locks--winners that have have a high probability (>0.75) yet better than expected odds.
